# Welcome to the CrashCoin Project

CrashCoin is a digital ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum blockchain which aims at providing a valuable digital asset in times of crypto market uncertainty. We developed this project bearing in mind that confidence in its value must be total and unalterable.

CrashCoin (CRASC) is a coin which has a limited total supply of 50 million units. **However**, each transfer of CRASC triggers a BTC/USD price check. If the price goes below 50,000 USD, each CRASC holder is eligible to the double of the CRASC he owns and will obtain them by direct transfer in the course of his next transaction. If the BTC/USD price goes below 40,000 USD, same process occurs again and every bearer will have its CRASC doubled in the course of his next transaction.

This goes on and on until the BTC/USD price falls below 10,000 USD. This leads to a total theoretical supply of CRASC of 1,600,000,000 if the Bitcoin price was ever to crash that much.

# FAQ

## How can I store CrashCoins?

You can use any ERC-20 compatible wallet such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/). Please be aware that the only valid contract reference for CrashCoin is **0x37783c524c3cc813fdb77963ece5ebe2d2501ca9**

## How can I obtain my additional coins if the BTC/USD price drops?

Your eligible coins will be transfered to you on your next transaction using CRASC. If you never use CRASC you can always send a few to yourself in order to trigger the bonus coins transfer.

## How do you ensure that the CrashCoin value remains stable?

The price drop events (below 50k, 40k, 30k, 20k, 10k) can only be triggered once. Thus if the BTC/USD price is fluctuating or going up again it will not trigger an additional event. Coins are strictly limited to a maximal theoretical supply of 1,600,000,000 CRASC - but for now only 50,000,000!
